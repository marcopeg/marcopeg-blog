In two days Michele and I are going to spend a week in Las Vegas as bullet proof plan to prevent our middle age crisis. We don't know if it's going to work but we both agree it's worth trying :-)

But that's not the point, not entirely anyway. [Did you hear about **US Custom and Border Protection seizing your phone** and sucking from it your entire digital identity?](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/ill-never-bring-my-phone-on-an-international-flight-again-neither-should-you-e9289cde0e5f) (which is made of stuff like emails, Facebook activity and other social data)

Here is an [article that suggest you protect your privacy](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/guide-getting-past-customs-digital-privacy-intact/), the currency of the future, from being stolen or placed under unrestricted control. Take a good read now!

Because of this I wrote a checklist of **what's on my phone and how to protect it**. I don't really need to create separated travel kits because I'm just going to Las Vegas once, but I am really considering to clean up my phone during the flight.

## Two Factor Authentication

First of all I made sure I have enabled [Two Factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) on all my critical services:

- Google Mail
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Dropbox
- AppleID

In addition I **saved all the recovery codes** into a file and I placed that file in my Dropbox account. At that point I printed Dropbox's recovery code (without any label nor explanation attached to it) and placed in my phone case. Another copy of it is in my luggage and I am considering just memorizing it.

> That security code is now **the single key to unlock my entire digital identity**, if used together with the proper username and password combination.

So far so good, isn't it? Well no, there is Apple of course!

## Think different (yeah, Apple does)

Of course Apple thinks different, **Apple doesn't provide any recovery code** for you to print and use... I searched Google for that code unsuccessfully. Nothing, nada. 

The only [valuable piece of information I found](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT204915) is that a code did exists but they removed it from _el Captain_ OSX version.

There is no code, and the only way to recover your account is to receive a code to a secure phone number or another apple device.

## How to defeat US Border Control?

Honestly? You can't beat them without buying a temporary phone that doesn't need to be activated with an AppleID.

It's a loophole:

- you reset the phone on the plane
- you land safely and go through the customs without any digital identity attached to you

so far so good but...

- you turn on your phone
- you have to set it up with your AppleID
- but the recovery code is sent to your own phone
- but the phone doesn't work just yet
- **d'oh!**

## End of the story

I think this is very much paranoid. I don't plan to reset my phone on the plane as I evaluate the chances to be placed under control very little.

But I do like to think about all those problems about our privacy, our data and how this very innocent blog post or a **Facebook comment might be placed out of context and used against me** in a future that I am not yet close to imagine. Who knows?

> Is it worth to care about your data? YES  
> Is it worth to loose your sleep on it? MAYBE NOT (YET)

What do you think?  
Do you feel safe?
