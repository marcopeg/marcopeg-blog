I like to start new project. No, **I LOVE** to start new projects. Starting new
projects give me the opportunity to **go deep into one single subject and learn**.

My [personal github](https://github.com/marcopeg) is filled up with short life span repos.
But some of them are more interesting than others and I plan to keep working on a more
serious level.

Here is a list of the projects that I am actively maintaining, where "maintain" means:

> activelery working on features **and documentation**

## fetchq

Fetchq is a Postgres based queue service. It's a task scheduler that handles parallel
queue processing and can scale from a tiny ~20Mb RAM development instance, to a
big scraping project with more than 100 servers working in parallel.

## stuffer

Stuffer is a file server where you can post stuff. It handles some nice features like
post-upload queued processing, and on-demand processing. Some use cases:

- upload videos that need to be transcoded
- upload images that need to be resized on demand
- upload PDFs of which you want to download only one page every 7

Yes, you can do all the weird things with files that NodeJS allows by writing simple
extensions with the language you love.

We already have some core-extensions that provide caching, S3 file storage and some
image resizing.
