I was born in Italy, it was the hot summer of '81.

The first thing I wished to do was to fly, luckily my second choice was coding!

I'm a Web Developer. I play with Javascript, Docker, mobile web apps and NodeJS. I did a lot of PHP in the past and still remember some of it.

I like to share code and solutions. I believe knowledge is a product worth to share so everybody can enjoy and improve our community value.

I'm working hard to become a dev coach and my big objective is to speak at international JS conferences. So far I take care of MalmoJS user group at FooCafe in Malmo.

I do paragliding, I love mountains, hiking and biking into nature. Recently I embraced sailing in the Baltic sea (no mountains in south Sweden!)
